# Introduction
Tic Tac Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a classic paper-and-pencil game that's often played by two players. The game is played on a 3x3 grid where players take turns marking a cell with their designated symbol, usually "X" and "O," with the objective of forming a straight line of their symbols either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The player who achieves this objective first wins the game, and if all the cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
To solve games using AI, we will introduce the concept of a game tree followed by minimax algorithm. The different states of the game are represented by nodes in the game tree.
The root node of the tree signifies the beginning position i.e. when the board is empty. After the root node we have the possible states or the children nodes which arise because of the player's move.
# Minimax Algorithm
The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm used in two-player games, such as Tic Tac Toe, to determine the best move for a player by considering all possible future moves and their outcomes. It's based on the concept of minimizing the possible loss while maximizing the potential gain, hence the name "Minimax".
